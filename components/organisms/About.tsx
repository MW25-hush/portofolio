            During my internship, I collaborated closely with esteemed
            professors to conceptualize and execute Morasilat, an application
            poised to replace the outdated paper-based systems currently in use.
            Through meticulous design and development, Morasilat offers a
            seamless transition to a modern, efficient, and accessible platform.

            My skill set extends beyond technical expertise to a genuine love
            for sketching and ideation, ensuring that each project not only
            meets functional requirements but also encapsulates beauty and
            usability. With a knack for bringing concepts to life, I harness the
            magic of Next.js to create dynamic and responsive applications. I
            look forward to contributing my skills and passion to further
            elevate the digital landscape, fostering innovation and efficiency
            in every project
