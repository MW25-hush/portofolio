                During my internship, I collaborated closely with esteemed
                professors to conceptualize and execute Morasilat, an
                application poised to replace the outdated paper-based systems
                currently in use. Through meticulous design and development,
                Morasilat offers a seamless transition to a modern, efficient,
                and accessible platform.
